#Ode for the little one

Oh Child,
What a palatable morsel art thou, tender as the ripest fruit
and the with the taste of the freshest remains.
Your rapid breathing and shivering body arouse me,
your tormented mind teetering of the edge of madness,
so encouraging
Child, sweetest dearest Child,
I love the shrill pitch of your screams, music to my ears
as I feel the air escape from your lungs for the last time.
Oh Child,
Nothing would make me happier than to consume every inch of your happiness
I will destroy you child
