#Towering Sonnet

Augmented Reality is so cool.  
At kiwijam there is a team that rocks,  
they worked together to create a jewel,  
a game that is better than silly walks.  
No joke, they built a tower to defend  
from an enemy that just will not quit.  
You will play this one till the bitter end,  
or give up if you don't have the spirit.  
Use the camera to your advantage,  
move it around to get the best angle.  
Kill attackers the best you can manage,  
before you end in a nasty tangle.  
A game in which your wildest dreams come true,  
Go give it a play or at least a view!
